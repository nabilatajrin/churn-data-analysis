### Objective
This project performs Linear Regression, predict the 'Price' from the test set, and find the RMSE value from the actual test data and the predicted data of used Ford cars.

### Variables
Model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuelType, mpg, and engineSize.

### Tasks
1. Load the dataset and perform data preprocessing <br>
2. Which approach works better for this dataset? A. One-hot Encoding or B. Label Encoding <br>
3. Perform Data Transformation (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler). Does Data Transformation improve model performance? Is it necessary to standardize or normalize data for tree-based machine learning models? <br>
4. Perform Grid Search and Cross-Validation with Decision Tree Classifier <br>
5. Show a tree diagram of the Decision Tree <br>
6. Show the Confusion Matrix, Classification report, and ROC-AUC <br>
7. Explain accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score <br>
