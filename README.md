### Objective
This project performs Linear Regression, predict the 'Price' from the test set, and find the RMSE value from the actual test data and the predicted data of used Ford cars.

### Variables
Model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuelType, mpg, and engineSize.

### Tasks
(A) Load the data, 
(B) Perform Label Encoding or One-hot Encoding (Explain which one is best suitable for your analysis)
(C) Split the original dataset into the train set (80%) and the test set (20%), 
(D) Perform Linear Regression and Predict the 'Price' from the test set, 
(E) Show the coefficients of your linear regression model for each feature and show the y-intercept value of your linear regression model. (Interpret the coefficients)
(F) Find the MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE, coefficient of determination values from the actual target variable and the predicted target variable.
(G) Compare the actual and predicted target variable through visualization
